    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>A classic story in Silicon Valley startup lore is Paypalâ€™s decision to pay people
            $10 to use their product. The
            reasoning was that if you could pay people to join eventually the network value would be sufficiently high
            that
            new people would join for free and you could stop paying. It certainly seemed to work, as PayPal was able to
            stop paying and continue growing, thereby bootstrapping its network effects.</em></p>

    <p style="text-align: center;"> <em>In crypto, we have adopted and extended this approach with airdrops, paying
            people not just to join but typically
            to use our products for some period.</em><br>...</p>
    <p> <br> </p>

    <p> Airdrops have become a multifaceted tool used to reward early users, decentralize protocol governance, and,
        frankly, to market something new. Formalizing the distribution criteria has become an art, particularly when
        determining who should be rewarded and the value attributed to their efforts. In this context, both the quantity
        of tokens distributed and the timing of their release, often through mechanisms like vesting or gradual release,
        play significant roles. These decisions should be grounded in systematic analysis rather than relying on
        guesswork, sentiment, or precedents. Using a more quantitative framework ensures fairness and strategic
        alignment with long-term objectives.</p>

    <p>The <a
            href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/14-13-psychology-and-economics-spring-2020/507249b30e34d9cb4040d15677d7519e_MIT14_13s20_rec2.pdf"
            target="_blank" class="gold-link">quasi-hyperbolic discounting model</a> provides a mathematical framework
        to explore how individuals make choices
        involving trade-offs between rewards at different times. Its application is particularly relevant in areas where
        impulsivity and inconsistency over time significantly influence decision-making, such as financial decisions and
        health-related behaviors.</p>

    <p>The model is driven by two population-specific
        parameters: present bias, \(\beta\), and the discount factor, \(\delta\).</p>
    <h3>Present Bias (\(\beta\)):</h3>

    <p>This parameter measures the tendency of
        individuals to prioritize immediate rewards over those that are further away
        disproportionately. It varies between 0 and 1, where a value of 1 indicates no
        present bias, reflecting a balanced, time-consistent evaluation of future
        rewards. As values approach 0, they signify an increasingly strong present
        bias, indicating a heightened preference for immediate rewards.</p>

    <p>For instance, given the choice between $50
        today or $100 in a year, a person with a high present bias (closer to 0) will
        prefer the $50 immediately rather than waiting for the larger sum.</p>

    <h3>Discount Factor (\(\delta\)):</h3>

    <p>This parameter describes the rate at which the
        value of future rewards diminishes as the time until their realization
        increases, accounting for the natural decline in their perceived value with
        delay. The discount factor is more accurately quantified over longer,
        multi-year intervals. When assessing two options in the short term (less than
        one year), this factor exhibits considerable variability as immediate
        circumstances can disproportionately influence perception.</p>

    <p>For generalized populations, studies show the
        discount rate is usually around 0.9. However, this value is often substantially
        lower among groups with gambling tendencies. <a
            href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10899-021-10054-x.pdf" target="_blank"
            class="gold-link">Research</a>
        indicates that habitual
        gamblers typically exhibit a mean discount factor slightly below 0.8, whereas
        problem gamblers tend to have a discount factor closer to 0.5.<label for="sn-1"
            class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
        <input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="sidenote-toggle" />
        <span class="sidenote">
            Problem gamblers are individuals who meet several criteria for pathological gambling and exhibit significant
            gambling-related issues, while habitual gamblers engage in regular gambling activities but do not exhibit
            the pathological behaviors associated with problem gambling.</span>
    </p>

    <p>Using the above terms, we can express the
        utility \(U\) of receiving a reward \(x\) at time \(t\) through the following
        formula:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">\( U(t) = \beta \delta^t U(x) \)</p>
    <p>This model captures how the value of rewards
        varies depending on their timing: immediate rewards are evaluated at full
        utility, while future rewards are adjusted downward in value, factoring in both
        the present bias and the exponential decay dictated by &#120575;.</p>

    <p>Last year, Pantera Cryptoeconomics Lab conducted a <a
            href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=d06fd68cfff142faf4c8f482730b1c1e52401e66"
            target="_blank" class="gold-link">study</a>
        to quantify the behavioral tendencies of crypto users. We surveyed
        participants with two straightforward questions designed to gauge their
        preference for immediate payment versus receiving some future value.<label for="sn-1"

            text</span>This
        approach helped us ascertain representative values for both \(\beta\) and \(\delta\). Our
        findings revealed that the representative sample of crypto users exhibits a
        present bias just above 0.4 and a notably low discount factor.

        bias and a notably low discount factor among crypto users, suggesting a

        This can be attributed to several interconnected factors within
        the crypto landscape:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cyclical Market Behavior: </strong> The
            crypto market is known for its volatility and cyclical nature, with tokens
            often experiencing rapid value fluctuations. This periodicity influences
            user behavior, as many are accustomed to navigating through these cycles
            rather than adopting the long-term investment strategies more common in
            traditional finance. The frequent ups and downs may lead users to discount
            future values more steeply, wary of potential downturns that could erase
            profits.</li>
        <li><strong>Stigma Around Tokens:</strong> The
            survey specifically asked about tokens and their perceived future value,
            which could have highlighted an ingrained stigma associated with
            token-specific trading. The stigma, tied to the periodic and often
            speculative nature of token valuations, reinforces a cautious approach to
            long-term investments in the crypto space. Additionally, suppose the
            survey had measured preferences using a fiat currency or another form of
            reward. In that case, the discount rates of crypto users might align more
            closely with global averages, suggesting that the nature of the reward
            could significantly influence the observed discounting behavior.</li>
        <li><strong>Speculative Nature of Crypto Applications:</strong>
            Today's crypto ecosystem is deeply rooted in speculation and
            trading, traits that are prevalent in its most successful applications.
            This tendency highlights that current users overwhelmingly favor
            speculative platforms, a preference reflected in the survey results, which
            show a strong inclination towards immediate financial gains.</li>

    </ul>
    <p>While the study's results may diverge from
        typical human behavior norms, they reflect the characteristics and tendencies
        of the current cryptocurrency user base. This distinction is especially
        pertinent for projects designing airdrops and token distributions, as
        understanding these unique behaviors allows for more strategic planning and
        reward system structuring.</p>

    <p>Take, for example, the approach by <a href="https://twitter.com/DriftProtocol" target="_blank"
            class="gold-link">Drift</a>, a
        perps DEX on Solana, which is gearing up to launch its native token. Drift has
        included a time-delay mechanism in their token distribution strategy, offering
        to double the rewards for users who wait 6 hours after the token launch to
        claim their airdrop. The time delay was added to mitigate the congestion
        typically caused by bots at the outset of airdrops and potentially help
        stabilize the token's performance by reducing the initial surge of sellers.</p>

    <p>Based on our presented research, with a
        doubled value for the reward, Drift could have delayed a few months and
        statistically should have appeased most of their end users. With the airdrop
        criteria as is, we expect almost all users to wait 6 hours to claim, as the
        discount associated with this time difference is negligible in the eyes of the
        model.</p>
